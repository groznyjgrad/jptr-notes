    "- If $T$ is nonempty, then it has a node called its **root** which has no parent\n",
    "- Each *other* node of $T$ has a **unique** parent $w$, and every node with parent $w$ is a child of $w$\n",

    "Tree terminology regarding relationships between nodes and substructures:\n",
    "- Siblings: two or more nodes which have the same parent.\n",
    "- Internal node: any node that has at least one child.\n",
    "- Leaf/External node: any node which has no children.\n",
    "- Ancestor: A node $v$ is an ancestor of a node $w$ if $v = w$ or if $v$ is an ancestor of a parent of $w$.\n",
    "- Subtree of $T$ rooted at $v$: describes the tree which consists of node $v$ and all its descendents in the tree $T$.\n",
    "- Edge: a pair of parent-child nodes, ex. $(u,v)$.\n",
    "- Path: a sequence of parent-child nodes, or a sequence of nodes in which any two consecutive nodes form an edge.\n",
    "- Ordered tree: describes a tree in which the left-to-right arrangement of siblings corresponds to a relationship that is relevant to the usage of the tree.\n",

Because nodes are internal aspects of the implementation of trees, it is appropriate to encapsulate the nodes using position objects. Practically, this means that the arguments to Tree methods are positions, not nodes. \n",
